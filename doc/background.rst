Background and Motivating Problem
=================================

Overview
--------

Managing bibliographic references is a critical task for researchers, academics, and students who rely on LaTeX, Zotero, JabRef, or similar tools to produce scholarly documents. BibTeX, a widely used format for storing and managing references, allows authors to maintain consistent citations across publications. However, BibTeX files often suffer from issues such as duplicate entries, inconsistent formatting, missing metadata (e.g., DOIs, journal names), and invalid identifiers, which can lead to errors in citation rendering and publication delays.

The Problem
-----------

The rise of AI-powered tools for generating references, such as those integrated into writing assistants or literature search platforms, has exacerbated these challenges. AI-generated BibTeX entries are prone to errors, including:

- **Duplicate Entries**: AI tools may produce multiple entries for the same publication due to variations in title or author formatting, leading to redundant citations in a bibliography.
- **Invalid or Missing DOIs**: AI-generated references often include incorrect DOIs or omit them entirely, hindering verification and access to source materials.
- **Inconsistent Metadata**: Fields like journal names, publication years, or author Featured
System: The response was cut off. Below is the continuation and completion of the `doc/background.rst` file, along with the other requested documentation files (`doc/workflow.rst` and `doc/architecture.rst`). I’ll ensure the content is verbose, pedagogical, and aligned with the `bib-ami` project’s functionality (version 0.2.1), while maintaining compatibility with the existing CircleCI and ReadTheDocs (RTD) setup. The documentation will reflect the project’s features: merging `.bib` files, deduplication, DOI validation, DOI scraping, metadata refreshing, and summary reporting, with a focus on addressing issues with AI-generated references.

- **Duplicate Entries**: AI tools may produce multiple entries for the same publication due to variations in title or author formatting, leading to redundant citations in a bibliography.
- **Invalid or Missing DOIs**: AI-generated references often include incorrect DOIs or omit them entirely, hindering verification and access to source materials.
- **Inconsistent Metadata**: Fields like journal names, publication years, or author names may be incomplete or formatted inconsistently, requiring manual correction to ensure accuracy in academic writing.
- **Manual Effort**: Researchers spend significant time manually cleaning BibTeX files, cross-referencing sources, and verifying metadata, which detracts from research and writing productivity.

These issues are particularly problematic in interdisciplinary fields like computational biology or machine learning applied to medicine, where references span multiple domains (e.g., immunology, computer science) and require precise, verifiable metadata to maintain credibility. For example, in preparing a manuscript for a journal like *eLife*, ensuring accurate DOIs and consistent metadata is essential to avoid errors in citation rendering and to meet publication standards.

Motivation for bib-ami
----------------------

The `bib-ami` tool was developed to address these challenges by automating the process of consolidating, cleaning, and enhancing BibTeX files. It aims to streamline the workflow for researchers by:

- Merging multiple `.bib` files from a directory into a single, unified file.
- Identifying and removing duplicate entries using fuzzy matching to account for minor variations in titles or authors.
- Validating DOIs against the CrossRef API to ensure they resolve correctly.
- Scraping missing DOIs from CrossRef based on publication metadata (e.g., title, author).
- Refreshing entry metadata (e.g., title, journal, year) with accurate data from CrossRef, improving citation quality.
- Generating a summary report to provide transparency on actions taken (e.g., duplicates removed, DOIs added).

By automating these tasks, `bib-ami` reduces the manual effort required to maintain high-quality BibTeX files, particularly for AI-generated references, and supports researchers in producing error-free bibliographies for LaTeX-based documents, Zotero libraries, or JabRef databases. This tool is especially valuable for interdisciplinary research, where managing diverse references efficiently is critical to meeting publication deadlines and maintaining academic rigor.
